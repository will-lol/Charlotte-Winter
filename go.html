        It's recess and everyone is talking about what they are doing on the weekend. You don't say anything until Adam Chambers walks past. He doesn't say anything, which is unusual. He has a determined look in his eye so you decide to not say anything. You return into the nightmare of last night and recall what happened. Just as you are remembering the finer details, Ben drops all his noodles on the floor.

        You laugh and ask: "What did everyone dream about last night?"

        Thomas chimes in: "Yeah I did. About Adam Chambers. He was acting like some kind of Gru character trying to take over the world it was so weird."

        Everyone is silent.
